# Rebel Akktors

This repository is a demo on how actors can send messages to each other, to be used during the Personio GmbH Tech Talks.

# The idea

We have a boss, and we have IT Guys.

The boss can ask the IT Guys to run a command for him but not every IT Guy is so nice to run it, they become a bit rebel, so they have to be insisted.

# Goal

The goal is having a **very basic** Akka example that allow us to:

- See how an actor can have internal state
- See how an actor can change its behavior if needed
- See actors comunicating via messages
- See how we can model the scenario without asking with `?` (ask) but just with `!` (tell)
